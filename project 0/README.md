## Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a Python program that guesses a randomly chosen number and prints the number of attempts it took to find it.

## What Problem Are We Solving?
We need to write a program that guesses a hidden number generated by the computer and displays how many attempts were required to guess it.

### Competition Conditions
- The computer randomly selects an integer between 0 and 100.  
- Our program tries to guess this number step by step.  
- After each attempt, the program receives feedback whether the guessed number is greater or smaller than the target.  
- When the correct number is found, the program prints the total number of attempts used.

### Quality Metric
The main performance indicator is the number of attempts needed to guess the number.

### What We Practice
We practice working with:
- Random number generation (`random` module)
- Loops and conditional statements
- Writing clean and understandable Python code

## Data Information
No external data are used.  
All numbers are generated automatically within the program.

## Project Workflow
1. The computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 100.  
2. The program makes guesses using a predefined algorithm.  
3. After each guess, the program checks if the number is higher or lower than the target.  
4. The loop continues until the correct number is found.  
5. The total number of attempts is printed to the console.

## Results
- The program successfully finds the random number.  
- The console displays the number of attempts required.

## Conclusions
In this project, we developed a simple Python program that guesses a randomly generated number and counts the number of attempts required.
